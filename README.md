# Web Development Labs 
This repository contains the laboratory assignments for the Web Development course at the Technical University of Moldova.
## [Scrapper](https://github.com/Flexksx/WebDevelopmentLabs/tree/main/Scrapper)
This lab focuses on building a scrapper, serialization and de-serialization, and a small riddle at the end of all tasks.
I have decided to use Python, since I am already familiar with BeatifulSoup4 and I have made scrappers in the past using this stack.
